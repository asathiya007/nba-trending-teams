suns,2021-11-24,"@DanWhitCongress @davidkurten @Birdonwing I’ll dumb it down for you! Extreme temperature drops, create ice formation and snow! 

Snow reflects the suns rays. This in turn creates colder weather, which creates more ice and snow. Which cools the weather further.

This could lead to an Ice Age. Time to panic."

wizards,2021-11-17,@doduehzb @natoverb @wizards_magic @arcaneshow I mean the simple answer is that wasn't the reason but even if it was magic is pushing original weight loss than it used to and making cards for the TV show doesn't directly compete because it advertises the game not the card game.
