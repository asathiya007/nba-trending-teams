76ers,2021-11-17,"I hate this guy. He says a ton of bs almost everyday on tv. Steph Curry got gsw 10-2 without Klay, KD has had Harden all season mf. Not to mention the 76ers without Embid. Smith should pipe down. https://t.co/4Wi1647lsR"
76ers,2021-11-19,Attended Denver-Philly game.  Credit the 76ers- they were desperate for a win..finally a W without Embiid.  Jokic is an incredible basketball player-but you know that. Denver didn’t shoot well. I’m sure they’ll be hungry for a W against the Bulls who need to play a full 48.
